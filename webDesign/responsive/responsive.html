			<h2>WHAT IS TESLA’S MISSION?</h2>
			<p>Founded in 2003, Tesla is Musk’s second project post-PayPal, and still one of his most ambitious.</p>
			<p>Tesla envisions a future of self-driving cars, where the majority of people travel by autonomous Tesla vehicles. It’s also a future where car owners seamlessly rent out their vehicles to serve as self-driving cabs while they’re not using them. Part of the company’s mission is to ramp up the global transition to sustainable energy.</p>
